* Computing of  one-way functions is relatively easy, but if you want to reverse them, it would take millions of years.
* Mathematically speaking, There is no proof one-way functions really exist.
* Trapdoor one-way fuction is the same as one-way functions, but there is a secret added, which makes the function computable in both directions.
* Hash functions take an input string, which varies in lenght, and converts it to an output string (hash value), which has a fixed length.
