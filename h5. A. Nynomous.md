## Quintin 2014:7 Things You Should Know About Tor

* Tor attacks have been succesfully done due to browser bugs or user misconfiguration, not because of Tor it self.
* Despite Tor's reputation as a host for criminal activity, it is actually more commonly used by activists, journalists and other regular people.
* Tor is open source and has been confirmed to not have any backdoors.
* Tor is easy to use and it is preferred that you run it pre-configured.
* Tor's security depends on the user. If used right it offers strong anonymity, but wrongly used, you can be tracked.

## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network

I downloaded TOR from their website: https://www.torproject.org/download/ and ran the installer.

Once installed, I opened the browser and connected to the TOR network.

I also changed the security setting from stantard to safest, which limits the use of java script on the websites.

## b) Browse TOR network

First website I ever opened was tor.taxi, which shows different websites you can browse around TOR.

It had direct links for different kind of sites. For example marketplaces such as incognito.

Incognito isn't really my type of marketplace, but it was really interesting to go through. Besides selling drugs, it had material for correct drug usage and safety.

tor.taxi also offers non illegal sites such as BBC, which is great and increases the freedom of the press.

One forum I visited was called EndChan. There wasn't really anything for me so I just quickly went through it.
