## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

* Cryptography is the science of keeping messages secure.
* Cryptanalysis tries to recover the message without acces to the key.
* Cryptographys requirements are confidentiality, authentication, integrity and nonrepudiation.
* The algorithm and all the possible keys, ciphertexts and plaintexts make a cryptosystem.
* The secrecy of the cryptosystem doesn't make it powerful. The best algorithms are the public ones which haven't been broken yet.
* To reduce the risk of attacks, the value of the data should remain less than the cost to break the security systems.
* Good cryptosystems are designed to work even after the expected rise in computing power in the future.

that's it. you're now officially a codebreaker! as you see, simple substitution ciphers can be broken with frequency analysis. see you at http://terokarvinen.com
