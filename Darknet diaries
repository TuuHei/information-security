The episode talks about a ramsonware service and the group behind it spreading it onto the world.
The guest of the episode is Will, who works for Equinix Threat Analysis Center as a threat intelligence analyst.
This episode was an interesting one. I've heard about ramsonware before and seen what it does, but I haven't read about
these attacks on these bigger companies discussed in the episode.

The main subject was a ramsonware as a service called REvil, which appeared in 2019. It allows ''clients'' to use the ramsonware, only if they
themself have succesfully got themself into the victim companys network. After succesfully doing that, REvil will do the 
rest of the work, and if the victim pays the fee, the payment will go 60/50 or 70/30 favoring REvil.
