## Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

* There are four key questions at the highest levels of threat modeling:
  - What are we working on?
  - What can go wrong?
  - What are we going to do about it?
  - Did we do a good enough job?
* Who should threat model? Well, everyone.
* The manifesto should be used as a guide to find the most suitable methodology for you.
* Is be used for improving the security and privacy of a system.


## Shostack 2022

* Ideally threat modeling is done at the development stage. It allows us to make the system as secure as we can by making changes quickly and easily.
*  Sketching is a useful tool, since people can express their first thoughts about the subject, which are probably imperfect, in a way that others can encage with the thought and start improving it.
*  ''What could go wrong?'' should be often in the back of our minds to actively asses different risks.


## Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model! â‚¬

* Threat modeling is about using models to find security problems
* The more you threat model, the better you become at it.
* Threat modeling should be organized enough to have structure, but not too organized so it doesn't kill creativity.
 
## OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

* It's important to recognize threat agents, who they could be and how could they attack the company.
* Likelihood measures the possibility of the threat becoming and attack.
* Mitigations is the easiest way to make attacks less likely or dangerous.


## a) Security hygiene

* Strong passwords - Passwords should be strong and you should have different password for different services / accounts.
* Don't download (Run) programs from unknown websites / senders (gmail).
* Keep your passwords safe.
* Watch out for sketchy links.
* Use firewall.
* Don't leave laptops or phones unsupervised in public places.


## b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.

My imaginary company is an online store selling technology products and services.

1) What are we building?

   The service is a small sized electronics store operated via internet.

2) What can go wrong?

   I used STRIDE as a threat identifying method.
   
Spoofing: Pretending to be someone you're not. Someone could pretend to be another customer or the website. (auth users, SSL cert)

Tampering: Someone might tamper with the data. 

Repudiation:

Information Disclosure:

Denial of Service:

Elevation of Privilege:

3) What are we going to do about it?

4) Did we do a good enough job?
