## Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

* There are four key questions at the highest levels of threat modeling:
  - What are we working on?
  - What can go wrong?
  - What are we going to do about it?
  - Did we do a good enough job?
* Who should threat model? Well, everyone.
* The manifesto should be used as a guide to find the most suitable methodology for you.
* Is be used for improving the security and privacy of a system.


## Shostack 2022

* Ideally threat modeling is done at the development stage. It allows us to make the system as secure as we can by making changes quickly and easily.
*  Sketching is a useful tool, since people can express their first thoughts about the subject, which are probably imperfect, in a way that others can encage with the thought and start improving it.
*  ''What could go wrong?'' should be often in the back of our minds to actively asses different risks.


## Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model! â‚¬

* Threat modeling is about using models to find security problems
* The more you threat model, the better you become at it.
* Threat modeling should be organized enough to have structure, but not too organized so it doesn't kill creativity.
 
## OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

* It's important to recognize threat agents, who they could be and how could they attack the company.
* Likelihood measures the possibility of the threat becoming and attack.
* Mitigations is the easiest way to make attacks less likely or dangerous.


## a) Security hygiene

* Strong passwords - Passwords should be strong and you should have different password for different services / accounts.
* Don't download (Run) programs from unknown websites / senders (gmail).
* Keep your passwords safe.
* Watch out for sketchy links.
* Use firewall.
* Don't leave laptops or phones unsupervised in public places.


## b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.

My imaginary company is an online store selling technology products and services.

## 1) What are we building?

   The service is a small sized electronics store operated via internet.

## 2) What can go wrong?

   I used STRIDE as a threat identifying method.
   
  
Spoofing Pretending to be someone you're not. Someone could pretend to be another customer or the website. (auth users, SSL cert)

Tampering: Someone might tamper with the data. If the site wants to attract customers, it must be reliable. This incules correct pricing, right contact information and right informations about the products. 

Repudiation: What if customers say they ordered something and they didn't receive it?

Information Disclosure: Can someone acces information they shouldn't?

Denial of Service: What if there is a rush of customers and the server can't handle it, or someone does a direct DDOS attack?

Elevation of Privilege: Could someone execute code without any privileges?

## Probability and risk

It is possible that the site has performance issues if there are too many customers at a same time. These could happen if the site launches a sale campaign. There would't be reasonable doubt to believe that someone wanted to DDOS our site, because there isn't much to gain.

Someone could try to impersonate some other customer/person and try to acces others information. Someone could also impersonate the website. It's easy to make a copy of the website and take information from those who think its the real one. 

Customer might claim they ordered something and a complaint comes when they didn't get it. If there isn't logs to back transactions up it is hard to know if they are telling the truth or not.

Someone could monitor our network and steal data through it. 

## 3) What are we going to do about it?

To reduce spoofing, I'd use a authentication method for users and would use a single domain for the website and SSL cerificate it. Also salt users passwords so hashes become different. 

To reduce the risk of denial of serice, I would run the website on the cloud. Cloud has the ability to increase resources if needed. 

If someone made a claim a product they ordered didn't ship to them I could check the logs if it is true or not. That means that the logs need to be also secure, so no one can tamper with them.

To reduce network monitoring there would need to be strong IP security.

## 4) Did we do a good enough job?
